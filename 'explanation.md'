There are a number of web browsers in the amrket today. They include: Opera Mini, Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Safari. These web browsers are very important as they enable one to: send documents via the internet, upload and download files, send emails, and they are able to stream vidoes and watch them. 
All these browsers have one thing in common. They all utilise the URL (Uniform Resource Allocators). These URLs have speciall addresses,  protocol:host.domain.first-level domain i.e example https://www.mishamwamngi.com/mackintosh/name.html
https: this is the protocol
www: is the host
mishamwangi:domain
.com: this is the first level domain
/:it shows the path that will be followed
mackintosh:location of the name.html file.
once the server has been able to allocate this, then it can comfortably run the application and give the user the required information
