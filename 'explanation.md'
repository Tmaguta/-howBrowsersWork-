There are a number of web browsers in the amrket today. They include: Opera Mini, Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Safari. These web browsers are very important as they enable one to: send documents via the internet, upload and download files, send emails, and they are able to stream vidoes and watch them. 
All these browsers have one thing in common. They all utilise the URL (Uniform Resource Allocators). These URLs have speciall addresses,  protocol:host.domain.first-level domain i.e example https://www.mishamwamngi.com/mackintosh/name.html
https: this is the protocol
www: is the host
mishamwangi:domain
.com: this is the first level domain
/:it shows the path that will be followed
mackintosh:location of the name.html file.
Browsers have a number of components which include: user interface, browser engine, rendring engine, networking, UI backend, JavaScript Interpreter and the data storage.
whatever a user views on their screen has passed a number of stages. most of the content online is in the form of HTML and CSS  elements. most of this happens in the rendiring engine, as its in charge of displaying content. once a user has searched something, the process is fast and one can't see the process, but it starts by detecting the html elements, which then goes into the html parser, which then goes to the DOM tree that checks the attachments, from here it goes through the render tree, to determine the display and how it will look then a user gets the displayed information
